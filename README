Algorithm Questions with some solutions. I am trying to create a repository with my own questions so thats it easier to look at them later.

Most of the Problems are from www.topcoder.com and Topcoder reserves the right to all the problems. I have just kept a copy of the problems in my source file to for easy reference.
